def get_feature_descriptors(image, xs, ys, window_width, mode):
    '''
    Computes features for a given set of feature points.

    To start with, use image patches as your local feature descriptor. You will 
    then need to implement the more effective SIFT-like feature descriptor. Use 
    the `mode` argument to toggle between the two.
    (Original SIFT publications at http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/)

    Your implementation does not need to exactly match the SIFT reference.
    Here are the key properties your (baseline) feature descriptor should have:
    (1) A 4x4 grid of cells, each feature_width / 4 pixels square.
    (2) Each cell should have a histogram of the local distribution of
        gradients in 8 orientations. Appending these histograms together will
        give you 4 x 4 x 8 = 128 dimensions.
    (3) Each feature should be normalized to unit length.

    This is a design task, so many options might help but are not essential.
    - To perform interpolation such that each gradient
    measurement contributes to multiple orientation bins in multiple cells
    A single gradient measurement creates a weighted contribution to the 4 
    nearest cells and the 2 nearest orientation bins within each cell, for 
    8 total contributions.

    - To compute the gradient orientation at each pixel, we could use oriented 
    kernels (e.g. a kernel that responds to edges with a specific orientation). 
    All of your SIFT-like features could be constructed quickly in this way.

    - You could normalize -> threshold -> normalize again as detailed in the 
    SIFT paper. This might help for specular or outlier brightnesses.

    - You could raise each element of the final feature vector to some power 
    that is less than one.

    functions, but depending on your implementation, you may find some useful. Please
